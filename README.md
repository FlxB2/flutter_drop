A flutter macOS plugin which allows dragging files outside your app

roughly based on:
- https://github.com/skalio/native-drag-and-drop
- https://github.com/superlistapp/super_native_extensions

But kept simple (regarding super_native_extensions) and with better drop support (regarding native-drag-and-drop)
